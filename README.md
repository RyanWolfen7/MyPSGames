# This is my PS Game App

In this project I tried to go for many new tech outside my comfort zone. In most cases it didn't end up nearly aswell as I hoped. Two all nighters later and I have something I could do with my favored tech Stacks, but I have to say it was worth it even if my display is poor. This is the my second typescript project ever and it definetly had a learning curve.

### Overview

The frontend is typescript and has a Redux Thunk structure. You currently can add you're favorite Playstation Games and check thier details.

The Backend is a RESTful backend with a mongo DB.
